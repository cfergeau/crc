Lots of things still need to be solved:
- how to pass ssh credentials for the remote host? they are currently hardcoded
- the multiplication of inconsistent xxxxResult types is messy, hopefully a
  good cleanup can be done ('status' struct in cmd/status.go,
  'ClusterStatusResult' in api/client/types.go, 'ClusterStatusResult' in
  machine/types/types.go)
- all commands need to be converted to going through the daemon
- the remote/local daemon can hopefully be dealt with through the daemonclient
  API, at the moment it's done manually/hardcoded in cmd/
