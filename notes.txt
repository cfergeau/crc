- implement a real progress bar
Downloading 1 files...
Downloading /home/teuf/.crc/cache/crc_libvirt_4.9.0.crcbundle 505MB / 2GB (17%) - 10.07MB/s ETA: 4m12s 
is fugly (no nice blue "INFO" before it, inconsistent with the progress bar we show when uncompressing,  "1 files", ...)

see e42127f4fb6ccda01cc511c05adc6d64bddbaaf6 can this be reused?

- download to a temp file and rename once download is done. Cleanup temp files if there are any (be robust against ctrl+c during download)

- check sha256sum before unpacking?

- fallback to download when failing to unpack the bundle archive

- need to check the bundle URL version matches the version expected by the binary

- when crc setup -b ... is used, persist the value that was passed somehow for use with crc start?
-> this is less of an issue when using presets

- Enabled the podman socket.
-> should be INFO ...

-  after crc start:

Use the 'podman' command line interface:
  $ eval $(crc podman-env)

?? What do I do aftr that? Use 'podman' ? 'podman-remote' ? something else?


- create smaller VM?

-in cmd/, postrun takes half a second -> this is the time it takes to send the telemetry


"Changes to configuration property 'preset' are only applied when the CRC instance is created."
"If you already have a running CRC instance, then for this configuration change to take effect, delete the CRC instance with 'crc delete' and start it with 'crc start'."

-> is this delete/start which is needed, or delete/setup/start (in case bundle is missing?)?

- disk resizing gets triggered when using podman?
